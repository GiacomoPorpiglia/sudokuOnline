# Sudoku online
### !!! Heroku page is currently down, so the website is not available :( !!!
Hey there! This is my first MERN stack project, and it is an online website where you can play Sudoku! <br/>
The sudoku grids are back-end generated thanks to a backtracking algorithm. Also, the algorithm makes sure the solution to the given grid is unique. <br/>
The website is responsive, so you can use it from different devices without any worries! <br/>
There are four difficulty settings (Easy, Medium, Hard and Extreme), so everyone can play having fun based on his skill level. <br/>
I had a lot of fun developing this project, and I feel like I've learned lots of things thanks to it, especially regarding the front-end work, styles ecc... <br />
Let me know if you encounter any problems during your user experience, and I'll try to solve them :) <br/>
Have fun!
