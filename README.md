# sudoku-game-online
Hey there! This is my first MERN stack project, and it is an online website where you can play Sudoku! <br/>
The sudoku grids are back-end generated thanks to a backtracking algorithm. Also, the algorithm makes sure the solution to the given grid is unique. <br/>
The website is responsive, so you can use it from different devices without any worries! <br/>
There are four difficulty settings (Easy, Medium, Hard and Extreme), so everyone can play having fun based on his skill level.
The website is hosted on Heroku, and you can find it [here](https://sudoku-game-online.herokuapp.com/) <br />
Have fun!
